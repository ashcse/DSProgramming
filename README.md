# DSProgramming
This repository is contains solutions to fundamental data structure and algorithmic problems. It contains projects demonstrating operations
on basic and advance data structures like linked list, binary search tree, AVL tree, Stack, Queues etc. All solutions are written in C# .Net. 

Idea behind this repository is to learn and demonstrate optimal solutions to common algorithmic problems by following conventional algorithmic approaches like Divide and Conquer, Greedy, Dynamic Programming etc.
