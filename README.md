# DSProgramming
This repository is contains solutions to fundamental data structure and algorithmic problems. It contains projects demonstrating operations
on basic and advance data structures like linked list, binary search tree, AVL tree, Stack, Queues etc.

Solutions are written in C# .Net. 

Idea behind this repository is to learn demonstrate optimal solutions by following conventional algorithmic approaches like Divide and Conquer 
, Greedy , Dynamic Programming etc.
